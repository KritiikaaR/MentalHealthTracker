Mental Health Tracker (JavaFX Mini Project)

This is a small personal Java project I built to practice what I’ve learned, including JavaFX, file I/O, collections, and basic UI design.

It lets users:
- Add their daily mood (1–10) and a short note
- View previous mood entries
- Visualize mood trends using a simple line chart

All data is stored in a local CSV file.

Tech/Concepts Used
- JavaFX (GUI & charts)
- File handling (BufferedWriter / Reader)
- CSV format
- Java collections
- Modular code structure


This wasn’t made to be a polished app. It’s just a personal project to help me apply Java basics, OOP, GUI interaction and simple data persistence. It’s been a helpful way to tie everything together while learning Java.
